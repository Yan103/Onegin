My uncle - high ideals inspire him;
But when past joking he fell sick,
He really forced one to admire him -
And never played a shrewder trick.
Let others learn from his example!
But God, how deadly dull to sample
Sickroom attendance night and day
And never stir a foot away!
And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
Of entertaining the half-dead:
One smoothes the pillows down in bed,
And glumly serves the medicine bottle,
And sighs, and asks oneself all through:
"When will the devil come for you?"
