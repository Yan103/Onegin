My uncle - high ideals inspire him;
But when past joking he fell sick,
He really forced one to admire him -
And never played a shrewder trick.
Let others learn from his example!

Sickroom attendance night and day
And never stir a foot away!
And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
Of entertaining the half-dead:
One smoothes the pillows down in bed,
And glumly serves the medicine bottle,
And sighs, and asks oneself all through:
"When will the devil come for you?"

By will of Zeus, the high and just,
The legatee of his relations --
As horses whirled him through the dust.

And bred upon the Neva's brink,
Where you were born as well, I think,
Reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
There once I too strolled back and forth:
But I'm allergic to the North...
