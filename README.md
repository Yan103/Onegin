# Onegin

Onegin is a unique program of its kind, which rearranges the lines of one of the best works of the most famous poet - Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin.

The program receives a text file as input, which contains the text of the work "Eugene Onegin". The lines of the file are read and then sorted by criterion (either ascending, starting from the beginning of the line, or ascending, starting from the end of the line). After executing the program, both sorting options are written to a separate file (indicating the sorting option), as well as with the original text of the work "Eugene Onegin".

Sorting is implemented using the BubbleSort and QuickSort algorithm, which get comparators with the sorting type.
