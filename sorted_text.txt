Default sorted Onegin text:
With this the hero of my tale:
Without preliminary feeler
While serious topics were disputing,
Where you were born as well, I think,
"When will the devil come for you?"
We all meandered through our schooling
Unforced, as conversation passed,
Treated his lessons as a ploy.
To pass for cultured in our ranks.
There once I too strolled back and forth:
The legatee of his relations --
The World found this enough to treat
Such were a young rake's meditations --
Struck for Evgeny, with its play
Sickroom attendance night and day
Reluctant to exhaust the boy,
Reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
Promptly had nothing left to give.
Proficiency to speak and write,
Or, with an epigram-surprise,
One smoothes the pillows down in bed,
Onegin was assessed by many
Onegin, my good friend, was littered
Of listening like a judge-supreme
Of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
Of entertaining the half-dead:
No moralizing from this joker;
My uncle - high ideals inspire him;
Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,
Made London's dandy his professor.
Let others learn from his example!
Let me acquaint you on the nail
It was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abbé.
I's easy, without too much fooling,
In the mazurka he was light,
In French Onegin had perfected
His hair was fashionably curled,
His bow was wholly unaffected.
He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
He really forced one to admire him -
He had the talent of saluting
He gave three balls a year, and rather
Haphazard; so, to God be thanks,
Had only debts on which to live.
From her Monsieur took on the child.
Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
Felicitously every theme,
Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
Eugene was free, and as a dresser
Eugene as clever, and quite sweet.
(Critical judges, strict as any)
By will of Zeus, the high and just,
But when the hour of youthful passion
But when past joking he fell sick,
But I'm allergic to the North...
But God, how deadly dull to sample
At first Madame gave him tuition,
As well-read, though of pedant cast.
As horses whirled him through the dust.
And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
And then a stroll in Letny Park.
And sighs, and asks oneself all through:
And now at last he saw the World.
And never stir a foot away!
And never played a shrewder trick.
And glumly serves the medicine bottle,
And bred upon the Neva's brink,
A mild rebuke was his worst mark,
After a fine career, his father
Of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes.
